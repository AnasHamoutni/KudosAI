This repository contains the source code of my web portfolio ([**KudosAI.com**](https://www.kudosai.com)) as well as those of my data science projects.

The source code of **KudosAI** is written in three languages: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JAVASCRIPT**. So, it's a static website which I've hosted in **Microsoft Azure** for **$0,20/month**.

For my Data Science projects, they are organized under 4 categories: **Computer Vision**, **Natural Language Processing**, **Time Series Forecasting**, and **Reinforcement Learning**.
The projects are written in **Python language** and you can test them on **Google Colab**.

The source code of **KudosAI** is in the folder **"KudosAI_source"** and is organized into three subfolders, **HTML folder**, **CSS folder**, and **JS folder**, and the source code of my projects is under the folder **KudosAI_projects_source** and is organized following the 4 categories previously mentioned.
